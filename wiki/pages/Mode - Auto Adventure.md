# 🗺️ Auto Adventure Mode

`AutoAdventureMode` tries to progress through the main story automatically.
It navigates between gyms, heals when needed and battles trainers using the
built in `LevelUpLeadBattleStrategy`.

This mode is experimental and meant as a starting point for full game
automation. Coordinates for gyms are placeholders and may require tweaking.

To use it, select **Auto Adventure** from the mode list. Make sure a fresh
save of FireRed or LeafGreen is loaded.
